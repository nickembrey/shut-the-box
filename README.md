# Shut The Box
Bart Massey

This Python 3 code is a tool for exploring
[Shut The Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shut_the_Box)
from an AI perspective. It currently supports Monte Carlo
play both randomly and with a simple heuristic.

To see the command-line options, say

        python3 stb.py -h

To run unit tests on the `choice()` function, say

        python3 choice.py
